# Past

# Present

Currently in NYC. Prior to that, I lived in South Africa, China, and Jordan for high school and the first part of college. Ask me about it!

Now, learning Javascript & Golang - mostly focused on full stack web but dabbling in a few areas.

Also, taking care of a baby, two cats, and my incredible wife.
