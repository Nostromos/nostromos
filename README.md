### Present
I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who builds beautiful and performant web experiences using TypeScript, Go, Next.js, and Tailwind, taking products from concept to deployment. Specialized in integrating LLMs to create intelligent, context-aware features that delight users and solve real-world problems. 

I'm most excited about making software work. Seeing it live in the real world, run, and do what it was meant to do (solve problems). I'm also interested in code that lives a long life - easy to understand, add to, and maintain. 

Formerly at [Datadog](https://datadog.com), [Blue Apron](https://blueapron.com), [InterviewJet](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/interviewjet), and [Etsy](https://etsy.com).
